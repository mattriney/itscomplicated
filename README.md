A coding challenge that I recently completed.

You are tasked with programming a clock with too much functionality.
<br>
Write functionality that performs the following when given a specific time:
<br>
Conversion to Roman Numerals
<br>
Conversion from 12-hour format to Military Time
<br>
Conversion from the Current Time Zone to UTC
<br>
Conversion from one Time Zone to Another
<br>
Return the angle between the Clock Hands
<br>
One custom function of your choosing


Todo:
front-end creation
<br>
refactor to add re-usable functions for various pieces
<br>
find good formula for roman hour conversion
